This is a list of implementations planned for future revisions. Before asking what to do, take a look at these points and try to get something done. Also try to keep this page in sync with the Todo page on the wiki, please.

Primary Goals:
-Cleanup
 *Add many exceptions (for missing files etc.)
 *Make sure the code is cross-plattform (at least Windows XP+Vista and GNU/Linux)
-Flying aircraft
 *Basic physics
 *Tracking camera
-Terrain/station (for better orientation and to have something to fly around :) )
-A skybox

Secondary Goals:
-Basic collision detection (no explosions or anything. just an event/an onscreen message)
